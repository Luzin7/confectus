# Architecture Refactoring & Test Suite Implementation

## 🏗️ Architecture Changes

- **Clean Architecture Implementation**: Restructured codebase following clean architecture principles with clear separation of concerns
- **Path Alias Migration**: Updated from old `@modules/*`, `@shared/*`, `@@types/*` aliases to new clean architecture structure:
  - `@core/*` - Core contracts and errors
  - `@application/*` - Use cases and DTOs
  - `@infrastructure/*` - External services implementations
  - `@configs/*` - Configuration files
  - `@templates/*` - Template files
- **Dependency Injection Refactoring**: Improved dependency injection patterns and service implementations
- **Repository Pattern Enhancement**: Consolidated repository implementations with consistent naming conventions

## 🧪 Test Infrastructure

- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: Added unit tests for all major components
- **Test Environment Isolation**: Implemented proper test isolation with mocked dependencies
- **Vitest Configuration**: Enhanced test configuration with coverage reporting and proper setup
- **Mock Infrastructure**: Created comprehensive mocking system for file operations, CLI interactions, and external dependencies

## 🔧 Technical Improvements

- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Enhanced type safety with strict TypeScript configuration
- **Error Handling**: Improved error handling patterns across all modules
- **Build Process**: Maintained existing build process with updated path references
- **Code Organization**: Better file structure following domain-driven design principles

## 🚀 Breaking Changes

- **Import Path Changes**: Updated all internal imports to use new path aliases
- **Class Name Standardization**: Renamed repository implementations for consistency
- **Module Structure**: Reorganized module boundaries for better maintainability

This refactoring provides a solid foundation for future development while maintaining backward compatibility for end users.
